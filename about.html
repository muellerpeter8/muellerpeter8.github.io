      <h2>Short Bio</h2>
      <p>It all began when Peter was born on a cold December night. He grew up like most kids of his generation, running around outside and enjoying his freedom and imagination. As he grew he found enjoyment in creating things with his hands and fiddling with old electronics. Years later, Peter decided he wanted to build robots, but that wasn't in the cards for his future. Jump forward many years and we find Peter in College studying Digital Media. With a desire to be creative and also create useful things, Peter decided designing and authoring DVDs would be a fun career path. But that was not to be as well. The writing on the wall and his wife said, "DVDs are a dying technology". Lucky for Peter, a very similar but much brighter prospect was available. Front-End Web Development building websites would be a great career option. Conveniently, Peter's wife was an artist and they both started their careers at the same company designing and coding up small websites. As they grew in their careers, they both decided to be a little more focused and Peter went the development route and his wife went the design route. They are now an amazing dynamic duo, designing and developing, not just websites, but their four awesome kids as well.</p>
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Peter loves to be creative and also is a big geek. He has developed a passion for Cosplay. In his spare time Peter creates costumes and wears them whenever he gets a chance. He joined a for charity cosplay group, Utah Screen Stars, a couple years ago and really loves the chance to bring smiles to the young and old alike. He also loves making costumes for his kids whenever he gets the chance.</p>
